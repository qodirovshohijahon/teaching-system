#### 2. Object Oriented JavaScript
Create a class called Person which accepts the name of a person as a string, and his/her age as a number.

The Person class should have a method called describe which returns a string with the following syntax: "`name, age years old`". So for example, if `John is 19 years old` then the function describe of his object will return "`John, 19 years old`".
