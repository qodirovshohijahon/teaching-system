fs handles file system operations such as reading to and writing from files. There are synchronous and asynchronous methods in the library. Some of the methods include the following:

- [x] fs.readFile(): reads files asynchronously
- [x] fs.writeFile(): writes data to files asynchronously

### Reading from and Writing to the File System in Node.js

Reading from files is done via the core fs module. There are two sets of reading methods: asynchronous (recommended) and synchronous. In most cases, developers should use async methods, such as fs.readFile because this method won't block the event loop:

```js
const fs = require('fs')
const path = require('path')
fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, '/data/customers.csv'), {encoding: 'utf-8'}, function (error, data) {
  if (error) return console.error(error)
  console.log(data)
})
```

To write to the file, execute the following:


```js
const fs = require('fs')
fs.writeFile('message.txt', 'Hello World!', function (error) {
  if (error) return console.error(error)
  console.log('Writing is done.')
})
```
