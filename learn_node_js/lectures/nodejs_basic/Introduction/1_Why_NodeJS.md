Why Node.js?
Let's start by taking a look at why Node.js is one of the fastest growing web platforms out there.

Node.js provides you with the following benefits:

Develop faster due to the vast number of modules and reusable code from npm
Make fewer mistakes and be more productive (One language across the stack)
Delight your user with fast response time (YMMV)
Reduce team size and communication overhead (full stack JavaScript)
Reduce dependency on other teams (e.g., backend API teams)
Ability to re-use code on the browser and server
Node.js Features
Node.js has some distinct features. Here are some examples of those features:

Non-blocking I/O: performant
Fast JS engine: browser arms race (Google Chrome V8 and Microsoft Chakra)
Expressive and interpreted language: don't waste time on setup
Solid and improving language standard (ECMAScript)
Built in package manager with a humongous number of packages (npm)
