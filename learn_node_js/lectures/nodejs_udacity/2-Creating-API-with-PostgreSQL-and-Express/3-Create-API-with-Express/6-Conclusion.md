Great job! In this course we've built the client-facing sections of an API, here's a look back at what we did:

Implemented RESTful API structure
Created Express functions for incoming requests
Organized Express routes into handlers
Mapped RESTful routes to model methods
Added endpoint tests
Glossary
CORS - Cross Origin Resource Sharing is required by browsers in order to access an API
Going Further
For more about REST, here is a [good article](https://restfulapi.net/) to get you started.
