Turning Ideas into Reality
Imagine this scenario:

My app is going to help people track their home electrical usage using bluetooth enabled electrical socket extensions, allowing users to view their most power hungry appliances, note which appliances have been running for an extended amount of time, know which outlets they use the most, and track their electrical usage throughout the year! Its going to be awesome! I have a front end in the works with a stunning user interface that everyone is going to love, and I need you to create the API to provide the data.

...Easy right? Or perhaps not. Part of being a software developer (and this really applies for both front and back end developers) is being able to translate abstract ideas for features or apps into concrete data structures. No where is this more true than in database design. It can be hard to take abstract ideas, identify their data needs, and meet those needs with tables and columns. In the video below, I take an abstract idea in the form of a task, discuss what data needs are implied, and update the database to complete the task.

Task 1 - Find and Update
A user let us know that there is a typo on one of the entries, but she can't edit it herself. Can you make sure that Dandelion is always spelled correctly?

Task 2 - Generating Reports
I need to report on activity within the app to show stakeholders that we are getting more traction and involvement. Can we get total entries week by week for the last month?
