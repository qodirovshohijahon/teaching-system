### Glossary

New Terms
Term	Definition
Access Modifier	Used in classes to declare how a property or method can be accessed from the application
Compile	Convert code from one language to another language with a different level of abstraction. Ex. Java to Machine Code
Duck typing	A programming paradigm where if two or more structures (functions, interfaces, objects) have the same properties, they can be used interchangeably regardless of any type declarations
Enumerated type	A set of constants that are automatically indexed and can be called by their name or index
Explicit Typing	When type is declared by the developer
Generic	A generic is a way to write a function that is reusable across different types
Implicit Typing	When type is Inferred by the compiler
Interface	Used as a blueprint to declare the shape of something reuseable such as functions, objects, and classes
lodash	A popular library for performing utility functions for things like arrays and numbers
Self-contained application	The use of self-contained implies the application receives data from no external sources
Strong-Typed	Types are important and require declarations. Steps need to be taken to change variables to different types
Transpile	Convert a language to a similarly abstracted language. Ex. ES6 to ES5
Tuple	A data type of an array with a set number of values where all value types are known
Weak-Typed	Types aren't declared and in some cases mixed and concatenated
